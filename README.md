# Starlight

This project is a simple ray tracer, written in Rust, that is based on skimming
the [Physically Based Rendering book](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html).

It can render scenes like these:

![First Render](renders/01-first-render-with-reflections.png)

![Reflections](renders/02-lots-of-reflections.png)
